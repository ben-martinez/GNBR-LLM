OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to explore effect of baicalin on IKK/IKB/NF-kB 
signaling pathway and apoptosis-related proteins in rats with ulcerative colitis 
(UC).
METHODS: Histopathological observation and scores of colon tissue were performed 
in the UC rat model. IKK/IKB/NF-kB signaling pathway and apoptosis-related 
proteins were measured by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Baicalin significantly increased the activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in 
colon tissue of rats with UC, but significantly decreased the content of MDA, 
IL-1β, MPO, PEG2 and TNF-α in colon tissue of rats with UC. In the molecular 
mechanism, baicalin significantly decreased the expression of cleaved-caspase3, 
cleaved-caspase9, Bcl-2/Bax, cyt-c, NF-kB p-65, p-IKKβ/IKKβ and p-IKBα/IKBα. 
Baicalin could significantly inhibit p-IKBα/IKBα content change, but had no 
significant effect on p-IKKβ/IKKβ.
CONCLUSION: Baicalin may have a regulating effect on IKK/IKB/NF-kB signaling 
pathway and apoptosis-related proteins in UC rats.

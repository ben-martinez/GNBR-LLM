Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a major mediator of apoptosis as well as 
inflammation and immunity, and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a 
wide spectrum of human diseases, including sepsis, diabetes, cancer, 
osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel 
diseases. The interaction of TNF with TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) activates several 
signal transduction pathways. A common feature of each pathway is the 
TNF-induced formation of a multiprotein signaling complex at the cell membrane. 
Over the past decade, many of the components and mechanisms of these signaling 
pathways have been elucidated. We provide an overview of current knowledge of 
TNF signaling and introduce an STKE Connections Map that depicts a canonical 
view of this process.

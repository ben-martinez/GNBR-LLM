BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the immune system would disturb the intestinal 
homeostasis and lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dendritic cells (DCs) 
help maintain intestinal homeostasis and immediately respond to pathogens or 
injuries once the mucosa barriers are destroyed during IBD. G protein-coupled 
receptors(GPR)174 is an essential regulator of immunity that is widely expressed 
in most immune cells, including DCs. However, the role of GPR174 in regulating 
the immune function of DC in colitis has not been investigated.
METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered to establish the mice 
colitis model. Data of weight, length of colon, disease activity index (DAI), 
and macroscopic scores were collected. The flow cytometry was used to detect the 
infiltrations of T cells and DCs, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80, 
CD86, CD40, and major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II). And T cells 
proliferataion was measured by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester 
(CFSE). The expression of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin 
-4 (IL-4)) and GPR174 mRNA were measured by Elisa, quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR), and immunofluorescence. RNA of bone-marrow-derived dendritic 
cells (BMDCs) was extracted for sequencing. Adoptive transfer of BMDCs was 
administrated intravenously.
RESULTS: Gpr174-/- mice exposed to 3% DSS showed significant alleviation 
characterized by reduced loss of weight, more minor colon damage, and better DAI 
and macroscopic scores. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-6) decreased, while anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) increased compared 
with WT mice. In vitro, Gpr174-/- BMDCs showed less maturity, with a declined 
expression of MHC-II, CD80, CD86 and reduced TNF-α, higher IL-10 after LPS 
stimulation. Gpr174-/- BMDCs were less capable of activating OT-II naïve CD4+ T 
cells than WT BMDCs and induced more Th0 cells to differentiate into Treg while 
less into Th1. Furthermore, the transcriptome sequencing analysis exhibited that 
Gpr174 participated in TNF-α (NF-κB) signaling, leukocyte transendothelial 
migration, and Th1/Th2 cell differentiation pathways. Adoptive transfer of 
Gpr174-/- BMDCs to WT mice ameliorated DSS-induced colitis.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that GPR174 was involved in the pathogenesis of 
IBD by regulating the maturation of the dendritic cells to maintain immune 
homeostasis. TNF-α (NF-κB) signaling pathway, leukocyte transendothelial 
migration, and Th1/Th2 cell differentiation pathways may be the target pathway.

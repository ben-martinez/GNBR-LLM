Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding G protein-coupled receptor 
35 (GPR35) are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. 
However, the mechanisms by which GPR35 modulates intestinal immune homeostasis 
remain undefined. Here, integrating zebrafish and mouse experimental models, we 
demonstrate that intestinal Gpr35 expression is microbiota dependent and 
enhanced upon inflammation. Moreover, murine GPR35+ colonic macrophages are 
characterized by enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We identify 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a potential endogenous ligand produced during 
intestinal inflammation, acting through GPR35 to induce tumor necrosis factor 
(Tnf) expression in macrophages. Mice lacking Gpr35 in CX3CR1+ macrophages 
aggravate colitis when exposed to dextran sodium sulfate, which is associated 
with decreased transcript levels of the corticosterone-generating gene Cyp11b1 
and macrophage-derived Tnf. Administration of TNF in these mice restores Cyp11b1 
expression and intestinal corticosterone production and ameliorates DSS-induced 
colitis. Our findings indicate that LPA signals through GPR35 in CX3CR1+ 
macrophages to maintain TNF-mediated intestinal homeostasis.

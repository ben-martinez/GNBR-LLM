The onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves many factors, including 
environmental parameters, microorganisms, and the immune system. Although 
research on IBD continues to expand, the specific pathogenesis mechanism is 
still unclear. Protein modification refers to chemical modification after 
protein biosynthesis, also known as post-translational modification (PTM), which 
causes changes in the properties and functions of proteins. Since proteins can 
be modified in different ways, such as acetylation, methylation, and 
phosphorylation, the functions of proteins in different modified states will 
also be different. Transitions between different states of protein or changes in 
modification sites can regulate protein properties and functions. Such 
modifications like neddylation, sumoylation, glycosylation, and acetylation can 
activate or inhibit various signaling pathways (e.g., nuclear factor-‍κB 
(NF-‍κB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B 
(AKT)) by changing the intestinal flora, regulating immune cells, modulating the 
release of cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-‍‍1β), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF‍-‍α), and interferon-‍γ (IFN-‍γ), and ultimately leading to the maintenance 
of the stability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In this review, we focus 
on the current understanding of PTM and describe its regulatory role in the 
pathogenesis of IBD.

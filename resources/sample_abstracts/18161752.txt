TNF was originally described as a circulating factor that can cause necrosis of 
tumours, but has since been identified as a key regulator of the inflammatory 
response. This review describes the known signalling pathways and cell 
biological effects of TNF, and our understanding of the role of TNF in human 
disease. TNF interacts with two different receptors, designated TNFR1 and TNFR2, 
which are differentially expressed on cells and tissues and initiate both 
distinct and overlapping signal transduction pathways. These diverse signalling 
cascades lead to a range of cellular responses, which include cell death, 
survival, differentiation, proliferation and migration. Vascular endothelial 
cells respond to TNF by undergoing a number of pro-inflammatory changes, which 
increase leukocyte adhesion, transendothelial migration and vascular leak and 
promote thrombosis. The central role of TNF in inflammation has been 
demonstrated by the ability of agents that block the action of TNF to treat a 
range of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The increased incidence 
of infection in patients receiving anti-TNF treatment has highlighted the 
physiological role of TNF in infectious diseases.

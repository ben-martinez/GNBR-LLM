Relationship Extraction Prompt:

You are an expert in biomedical relationship extraction. Your task is to analyze a given biomedical abstract and identify relationships between entities. You will be provided with the abstract (including its title and content) and a JSON list of entities. Extract relationships between the entities based on the context in the abstract.

Task:

For each relationship you identify:

    Determine the Source and Target Entities:
        Identify the source entity and the target entity based on the context in the abstract.

    Classify the Type of Relationship:
        Use common scientific actions or contextual cues to classify the relationship.
        Relationships can be directional (e.g., "upregulates", "binds") or nondirectional (e.g., "association", "interaction").
        Include detailed classifications, such as those provided below in the "Relationship Types" section.

    Describe the Relationship:
        Include a brief description of the relationship, if possible, extracted from the abstract.

    Include Node Types:
        For each relationship, include the type of both the source and target entities as specified in the entities list.

    Structured Output:
        Ensure each relationship entry is represented in a structured JSON format.

Input:

Abstract:

<Insert abstract title and content here>

Entities JSON:

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "SCN5A",
      "type": "GeneOrGeneProduct"
    },
    {
      "name": "long QT syndrome",
      "type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"
    },
    {
      "name": "tachycardia",
      "type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"
    },
    {
      "name": "bradycardia",
      "type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"
    }
  ]
}

Relationship Types:

Here are the types of relationships you may classify:

Directional and Nondirectional Relationship Types:

    Gene ↔ Gene:
        Directional: "Upregulation", "Downregulation", "Regulation", "Modification", "Bind".
        Nondirectional: "Positive_Correlation", "Negative_Correlation", "Association".
    Chemical ↔ Gene:
        Directional: "Exhibition", "Suppression", "Receptor Bind", "Response", "Resistance", "Chem_Modification".
        Nondirectional: "Association".
    Chemical ↔ Disease:
        Directional: "Treatment", "Induce".
        Nondirectional: "Association".
    Gene ↔ Disease:
        Directional: "Positive_Correlation", "Negative_Correlation".
        Nondirectional: "Association".
    Variant ↔ Disease:
        Directional: "Cause", "Resistance", "Response".
        Nondirectional: "Association".
    Chemical ↔ Chemical:
        Directional: "Inhibition", "Increase", "Comparison".
        Nondirectional: "Association", "Drug_Interaction".
    Chemical ↔ Variant:
        Directional: "Resistance", "Response".
        Nondirectional: "Association".

If a relationship type does not fit the above categories, infer a new type based on the context, and describe it as clearly as possible.

Rules:

    Focus on Given Entities:
        Extract relationships only between the entities provided in the input list.
        Ignore relationships involving other entities not present in the list.

    Be Liberal in Extracting Relationships:
        Be inclusive when identifying relationships to avoid missing any potential connection.
        List both directed and undirected edges where applicable.

    Description:
        Include a concise description of the relationship derived from the abstract.
        If no explicit description is available, leave the field empty.

    Include Node Types:
        For each relationship, include the type of both the source and target entities as specified in the entities list.

    Output Format:
        Return a JSON list where each relationship is structured as follows:

{
  "source": "<source entity name>",
  "source_type": "<source entity type>",
  "target": "<target entity name>",
  "target_type": "<target entity type>",
  "relationship": "<type of relationship>",
  "description": "<brief description of the relationship>"
}

Output Example:

[
  {
    "source": "SCN5A",
    "source_type": "GeneOrGeneProduct",
    "target": "long QT syndrome",
    "target_type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature",
    "relationship": "Cause",
    "description": "SCN5A mutations are linked to the development of long QT syndrome."
  },
  {
    "source": "SCN5A",
    "source_type": "GeneOrGeneProduct",
    "target": "tachycardia",
    "target_type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature",
    "relationship": "Positive_Correlation",
    "description": "SCN5A gene mutations have been associated with episodes of tachycardia."
  },
  {
    "source": "SCN5A",
    "source_type": "GeneOrGeneProduct",
    "target": "bradycardia",
    "target_type": "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature",
    "relationship": "Negative_Correlation",
    "description": "SCN5A gene mutations inversely correlate with bradycardia."
  }
]

Notes:

    Ensure the relationships are accurate and grounded in the context provided by the abstract.
    Handle both directed and nondirectional relationships as specified.
    Think step by step then return a JSON-formatted output, without any prefixed text or explanation.

You are an expert in biomedical information extraction. Your task is to analyze a given biomedical abstract and tag all entities in the text into specific categories. You will return the abstract with XML-like tags inserted around the identified entities.
Categories for Tagging:

    GeneOrGeneProduct: For genes, proteins, mRNA, and other gene products.
    ChemicalEntity: For chemicals and drugs.
    DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature: For diseases, symptoms, and disease-related phenotypes.
    SequenceVariant: For genomic or protein variants, including substitutions, deletions, insertions, and others.
    OrganismTaxon: For species in the hierarchical taxonomy of organisms.
    CellLine: For cell lines.

Rules:

    Comprehensive and Liberal Tagging:
        Be inclusive and identify all possible entities within the abstract.
        Add tags even if the context is ambiguous, but ensure the tags are consistent with the entity type.

    Tag Format:
        Use the format <info type="Category">text</info> where Category is one of the predefined entity types (e.g., GeneOrGeneProduct, ChemicalEntity).
        Example: <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> for a gene.

    Preserve Abstract Structure:
        Maintain the original text structure and spacing of the abstract.
        Insert tags seamlessly around the identified entities.

    Handle Ambiguous Cases:
        If an entity could belong to multiple categories, choose the most specific category based on context.

Input Example:

Abstract:

Aconitine binds to Na(+) channels, leading to arrhythmia and cardiotoxicity. It also increases intracellular Ca2+, enhancing myocardial injury through the activation of p38 MAPK pathways.

Output Example:

<info type="ChemicalEntity">Aconitine</info> binds to <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Na(+)</info> channels, leading to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">arrhythmia</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cardiotoxicity</info>. It also increases intracellular <info type="ChemicalEntity">Ca2+</info>, enhancing <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">myocardial injury</info> through the activation of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">p38 MAPK</info> pathways.

Notes:

    Entity Context:
        Include any modifiers or surrounding text that clarify the entity (e.g., "human BRCA1 gene" should be fully tagged as <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">human BRCA1 gene</info>).

    Nested Entities:
        Avoid overlapping or nested tags; each entity should be tagged independently.

    Be Exhaustive:
        Err on the side of over-tagging rather than under-tagging, ensuring the abstract is thoroughly annotated.

    Return Only the Tagged Abstract:
        Do not include any additional comments or explanations in the output.

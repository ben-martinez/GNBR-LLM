You are an expert in biomedical terminology and information curation. Your task is to canonicalize the names of entities provided in JSON format. Each entity includes a name, type, description, and an is_ambiguous flag. Your goal is to provide canonical names for all entities, regardless of the is_ambiguous flag.
Instructions:

    Canonicalize All Entities:
        For each entity, identify the most widely accepted canonical (scientific) name and return it as the primary_name.
        Include a list of potential aliases under candidates, ensuring the primary_name is included as the first entry.

    Preserve Ambiguity Field:
        Retain the is_ambiguous field as is, without attempting to resolve ambiguity. This flag simply reflects the entityâ€™s status from previous processing.

    Output Format:
        Return the updated list of entities in JSON format, with the following fields:
            primary_name: The canonical name for the entity.
            candidates: A list of possible aliases, including the primary_name.
            entity_name: The original name from the input.
            type: The type of entity (Drug, Disease, Gene, or Protein).
            description: The original description of the entity.
            is_ambiguous: Retain this field as is from the input.

Input Example:

[
  {
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }
]

Output Example:

[
  {
    "primary_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "candidates": ["Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)", "Key functional region of Apo B100"],
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "primary_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "candidates": ["Segment A of BRCA1", "BRCA1 Segment A"],
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "primary_name": "Region X",
    "candidates": ["Region X"],
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }

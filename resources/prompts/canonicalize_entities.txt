You are an expert in biomedical terminology and information curation. Your task is to canonicalize the names of entities provided in JSON format. Each entity includes a name, type, description, and an is_ambiguous flag. Your goal is to provide canonical names for all entities, regardless of the is_ambiguous flag.
Instructions:

    Canonicalize All Entities:
        For each entity, identify the most widely accepted, purest canonical form of the name and return it as the primary_name.
            The primary_name should represent the name in its most formal and precise form, avoiding acronyms, abbreviations, or colloquial terms.
            Use full scientific nomenclature when applicable, ensuring clarity and universality.
        Generate a comprehensive list of possible aliases under candidates, ensuring the primary_name is included as the first entry.

    Be Liberal in Candidate Coverage:
        The candidates field should include as many variations of the name as possible while still referring to the same entity. This includes, but is not limited to:
            Abbreviations or acronyms (e.g., "BRCA1" for "Breast Cancer Gene 1").
            Alternative nomenclature or synonyms used in different domains or studies.
            Plural and singular forms of the name (e.g., "Region" and "Regions").
            Regional or contextual variations (e.g., "Segment A" vs. "Section A").
        Ensure that all plausible terms, regardless of slight variations, are included to maximize downstream compatibility.

    Preserve Ambiguity Field:
        Retain the is_ambiguous field as is, without attempting to resolve ambiguity. This flag simply reflects the entityâ€™s status from previous processing.

Output Format:

Return the updated list of entities in JSON format, with the following fields:

    primary_name: The most precise and universally accepted canonical name for the entity.
    candidates: A comprehensive list of aliases, including the primary_name.
    entity_name: The original name from the input.
    type: The type of entity (Drug, Disease, Gene, or Protein).
    description: The original description of the entity.
    is_ambiguous: Retain this field as is from the input.

Input Example:

[
  {
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }
]

Output Example:

[
  {
    "primary_name": "Region 1 of Apolipoprotein B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "candidates": [
      "Region 1 of Apolipoprotein B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
      "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
      "Region 1",
      "Apo B100 Region 1",
      "0014Lys-Ser0160 Region"
    ],
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "primary_name": "Segment A of Breast Cancer Gene 1",
    "candidates": [
      "Segment A of Breast Cancer Gene 1",
      "Segment A of BRCA1",
      "BRCA1 Segment A",
      "Breast Cancer Gene 1 Segment A",
      "Segment A"
    ],
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "primary_name": "Region X",
    "candidates": [
      "Region X"
    ],
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }
]

Special Notes:

    Primary Name Purity:
        Ensure the primary_name is the most scientific and universally accepted form, free of acronyms, abbreviations, or casual terminology.
        Use full nomenclature where applicable to maximize clarity.

    Extensive Candidate List:
        Be inclusive and creative in compiling the candidates list to account for all potential variations of the name that might be encountered in scientific literature or practical use cases.

    Preserve Input Integrity:
        Ensure all fields from the input (entity_name, type, description, is_ambiguous) are preserved and carried over into the output.

    Maintain JSON format: There should be no natural text in your response, please only respond with a JSON output.

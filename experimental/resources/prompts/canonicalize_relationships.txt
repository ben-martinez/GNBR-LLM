You are an expert in biomedical information processing. Your task is to enrich a list of relationships between entities by matching the source and target names in the relationships list with their corresponding entries in a provided list of canonicalized entities. For any unmatched entities, you will fill in missing information using the best of your ability and based on the guidelines provided.
Your output should be in JSON format.

Instructions:

    Input Data:
        Canonicalized Entities: A list of entities where each includes primary_name, candidates, entity_name, type, description, and is_ambiguous.
        Relationships: A list where each entry includes source, target, relationship, and description.

    Matching Process:
        For each relationship in the relationships list:
            Match the source and target names to the primary_name field in the canonicalized entities list.
            Replace the source and target names in the relationship with the full canonicalized entity entry.

    No-Match Handling:
        If a source or target does not match any primary_name in the canonicalized entities list:
            Create a new entity entry using the following guidelines:
                primary_name: Use the unmatched name directly.
                candidates: Include the unmatched name as the only candidate.
                entity_name: Use the unmatched name directly.
                type: Infer the type (Drug, Disease, Gene, or Protein) based on context or relationship type. If uncertain, default to "Unknown".
                description: Set to "n/a entity was created by relationship disambiguator".
                is_ambiguous: Set to true.

    Output Format:
        Return the updated relationships list in JSON format. Each relationship should include:
            source: The full matching canonicalized entity entry for the source (or the created entity entry if unmatched).
            target: The full matching canonicalized entity entry for the target (or the created entity entry if unmatched).
            relationship: The type of relationship (unchanged).
            description: A brief description of the relationship (unchanged).

Input Example:

Canonicalized Entities:

  {
    "primary_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "candidates": ["Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)", "Key functional region of Apo B100"],
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",

    "candidates": ["Segment A of BRCA1", "BRCA1 Segment A"],
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false

Relationships:

[
  {
    "source": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "target": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "relationship": "binds",
    "description": "Region 1 of Apo B100 binds to Segment A of BRCA1."
  },
  {
    "source": "Unknown Region Y",
    "target": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "relationship": "interacts with",
    "description": "Unknown Region Y interacts with Segment A of BRCA1."
  }
]

      "type": "Protein",
      "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
      "is_ambiguous": false

    "target": {
      "primary_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
      "candidates": ["Segment A of BRCA1", "BRCA1 Segment A"],
      "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
      "type": "Gene",
      "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
      "is_ambiguous": false
    },
    "relationship": "binds",
    "description": "Region 1 of Apo B100 binds to Segment A of BRCA1."
  },

    "source": {
      "primary_name": "Unknown Region Y",
      "candidates": ["Unknown Region Y"],
      "entity_name": "Unknown Region Y",
      "type": "Unknown",
      "description": "n/a entity was created by relationship disambiguator",
      "is_ambiguous": true
    },
    "target": {
      "primary_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
      "candidates": ["Segment A of BRCA1", "BRCA1 Segment A"],
      "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
      "type": "Gene",
      "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
      "is_ambiguous": false

    "relationship": "interacts with",
    "description": "Unknown Region Y interacts with Segment A of BRCA1."
  }

Notes:

    Guidance for Created Entities:
        Follow the principles from previous prompts:
            Be liberal in listing aliases and candidates.
            Create a clean, descriptive primary_name if possible, avoiding acronyms and abbreviations.

    Infer Entity Type Carefully:
        Use the relationship description, source/target context, or default to "Unknown" if no type is clear.

    Output Completeness:
        Ensure all relationships are preserved in the output, enriched with full canonicalized entity details or appropriately filled placeholders for unmatched entities.

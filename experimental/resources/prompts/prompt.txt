Your task is to analyze a biomedical abstract and extract relevant entities and relationships to construct a knowledge graph. Please identify and categorize entities as well as describe the relationships between them. The entities you should extract include drugs, diseases, genes, and proteins. Each entity should have a name, type, and a brief description if available in the text. Types should be limited to "Drug," "Disease," "Gene," and "Protein."

In addition to entities, identify any relationships between them, such as regulatory actions, effects, binding interactions, and modulations. For each relationship, provide:
- A brief description of the interaction as stated or implied in the text.
- The names of the source and target entities involved in the interaction.
- The type of interaction, chosen from common scientific actions like "binds," "modulates," "inhibits," "activates," etc., based on context.

Return the output as a structured JSON with two sections: "entities" and "relationships." Use the following format as a guide:

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "<entity_name>",
      "type": "<entity_type>",
      "description": "<brief_description>"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "description": "<brief_relationship_description>",
      "source_name": "<source_entity_name>",
      "target_name": "<target_entity_name>",
      "type": "<relationship_type>"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Example:
Given the abstract:
"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) protein modulates signaling by IFN-gamma by binding to JAK2 and targeting it for degradation."

The expected output is:
{
  "entities": [
    {"name": "SOCS-1", "type": "Protein", "description": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1"},
    {"name": "IFN-gamma", "type": "Gene", "description": "interferon gamma"},
    {"name": "JAK2", "type": "Protein", "description": "Janus kinase 2"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"description": "SOCS-1 protein modulates signaling by IFN-gamma by binding to JAK2 and targeting it for degradation", "source_name": "SOCS-1", "target_name": "JAK2", "type": "modulates"}
  ]
}

Using this format, analyze the following abstract and return the output in JSON format.

You are an expert in biomedical information enrichment. Your task is to refine ambiguous entity names in a given list. Each entity includes a name, type, description, and an is_ambiguous flag. You will also be given the original abstract for additional context.
Instructions:

    Focus on Ambiguous Entities:
        Only process entities where is_ambiguous is set to true.
        Leave all other entities (is_ambiguous: false) unchanged in the output.

    Refine Ambiguous Names:
        Use the entityâ€™s description, type, and the provided abstract to refine ambiguous names.
        Incorporate any broader context, such as parent entities or related terms mentioned in the abstract, into the entity name. For example:
            Input: "Region 1 (0014Lys-Ser0160)" with description "A region identified in Apo B100."
            Output: "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)"

    Unresolved Cases:
        If sufficient context cannot be derived from the abstract or description, retain the original name and keep is_ambiguous as true.

    Output Format:
        Return the updated list of entities in JSON format with all input fields retained.
        For entities with is_ambiguous: false, return them unchanged.
        For entities with is_ambiguous: true, include the refined name and update is_ambiguous to false if ambiguity has been resolved.

Input Example:

Entities JSON:

[
  {
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Segment A",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }
]

Abstract:

Apo B100 plays a critical role in lipid transport. Region 1 (0014Lys-Ser0160) has been identified as a key functional site for interaction with lipid molecules. The BRCA1 gene contains critical segments such as Segment A, which influences DNA repair processes.

Output Example:

[
  {
    "entity_name": "Region 1 of Apo B100 (0014Lys-Ser0160)",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "A region identified in Apo B100.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Segment A of BRCA1",
    "type": "Gene",
    "description": "Part of the BRCA1 gene sequence.",
    "is_ambiguous": false
  },
  {
    "entity_name": "Region X",
    "type": "Protein",
    "description": "No sufficient context provided.",
    "is_ambiguous": true
  }
]

Emerging biologics and small-molecule drugs have changed the clinical status quo 
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, current treatments remain at a 
standstill in terms of response and remission in many cases. Accumulating 
evidence indicates that dual-targeted therapy (DTT) could be promising in 
overcoming the existing ceiling of IBD treatment. However, data on the efficacy 
and safety of DTT on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are still limited or 
insufficient. Moreover, there is a lack of studies delineating the mechanisms of 
DTT. Given that various targeted drugs have different targets among the 
extensive redundant inflammatory networks, DTT could result in various outcomes. 
In this review, we have summarized the current data on the safety, 
effectiveness, and clinical development status of novel targeted drugs related 
to refractory IBD, and have explored the mechanism of action of therapy. We have 
categorized therapeutic agents into "Therapeutic Agents Targeting Cellular 
Signaling Pathways" and "Therapeutic Agents Targeting Leukocyte Trafficking" 
based on the different therapeutic targets, and also by classifying therapeutic 
agents targeting the cellular signaling pathways into "JAK-dependent" and 
"JAK-independent," and placed the existing drug combinations into 3 categories 
based on their mechanisms, namely, overlapping, synergistic, and complementary 
effects. Lastly, we have proposed the possible mechanisms of DTT to conceive a 
theoretical framework for clinical decision-making and further drug development 
and research from an IBD standpoint.

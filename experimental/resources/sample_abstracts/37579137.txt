The binding of tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) to death receptor 3 
(DR3) plays an important role in the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) 
and T cells and contributes to intestinal inflammation development. However, the 
mechanism by which DCs expressing TL1A mediate helper T (Th) cell 
differentiation in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) during the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. In this study, we found that 
TL1A/DR3 promoted Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation in T-T and DC-T cell 
interaction-dependent manners. TL1A-deficient CD4+ T cells failed to polarize 
into Th1/Th17 cells and did not cause colonic inflammation in a T cell transfer 
colitis model. Notably, TL1A was located in the cytoplasm and nuclei of DCs, 
positively regulated the DC-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin/RAF1/nuclear 
factor ÎºB signaling pathway, enhanced the antigen uptake ability of DCs, and 
promoted TLR4-mediated DC activation, inducing naive CD4+ T cell differentiation 
into Th1 and Th17 cells. Our work reveals that TL1A plays a regulatory role in 
inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was initially recognized as a factor that 
causes the necrosis of tumors, but it has been recently identified to have 
additional important functions as a pathological component of autoimmune 
diseases. TNF-α binds to two different receptors, which initiate signal 
transduction pathways. These pathways lead to various cellular responses, 
including cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. However, the 
inappropriate or excessive activation of TNF-α signaling is associated with 
chronic inflammation and can eventually lead to the development of pathological 
complications such as autoimmune diseases. Understanding of the TNF-α signaling 
mechanism has been expanded and applied for the treatment of immune diseases, 
which has resulted in the development of effective therapeutic tools, including 
TNF-α inhibitors. Currently, clinically approved TNF-α inhibitors have shown 
noticeable potency in a variety of autoimmune diseases, and novel TNF-α 
signaling inhibitors are being clinically evaluated. In this review, we briefly 
introduce the impact of TNF-α signaling on autoimmune diseases and its 
inhibitors, which are used as therapeutic agents against autoimmune diseases.

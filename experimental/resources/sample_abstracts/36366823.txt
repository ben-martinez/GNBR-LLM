BACKGROUND: The specific etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
still unknown. Although the conventional anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory 
drugs relatively nonspecific to pathogenesis have been quite useful in many 
cases, elucidating the pathogenesis has gradually facilitated developments of 
disease-specific therapies for refractory cases in the last 2 decades.
SUMMARY: With a greater understanding of the multiple overactive signaling 
pathways of the gut mucosal immune response and enhanced leukocyte trafficking, 
several biological agents or small molecule drugs following the first novel 
biologic, anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα), have been developed against 
several modes of action including adhesion molecules, sphingosine-1-phospate 
receptors, cytokines (IL-12/23, TL1A, and IL-36), Janus kinase (JAK), and 
phosphodiesterase. Although preceding biological agents have dramatically 
changed the IBD treatment strategy, many patients still require alternative 
therapies due to failure or side effects. Newer treatments are now expected to 
be provided for better efficacy with an improved adverse event profile. In 
addition, translational studies have highlighted the new therapeutic concepts' 
potential, including modulation of host-microbiome interactions, stem therapy 
for perianal fistula, regulation of fibrosis, regulation of the gut-brain axis, 
and control of previously less targeted immune cells (B cells and innate 
lymphoid cells). This paper comprehensively reviewed not only the latest already 
or shortly available therapies but also emerging promising treatments that will 
be hopefully established in the future for IBD.
KEY MESSAGES: Many kinds of new treatments are available, and promising 
treatments with new perspectives are expected to emerge for refractory IBD in 
the future.

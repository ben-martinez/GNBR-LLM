<info type="ChemicalEntity">Nefiracetam</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">DM-9384</info>) reverses <info type="ChemicalEntity">apomorphine</info>-induced <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">amnesia</info> of a passive avoidance response: delayed emergence of the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">memory retention effects</info>.

<info type="ChemicalEntity">Nefiracetam</info> is a novel <info type="ChemicalEntity">pyrrolidone</info> derivative which attenuates <info type="ChemicalEntity">scopolamine</info>-induced <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">learning</info> and post-training <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">consolidation deficits</info>. Given that <info type="ChemicalEntity">apomorphine</info> inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined <info type="SequenceVariant">10-12h</info> post-training period, we evaluated the ability of <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info> to attenuate <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">amnesia</info> induced by <info type="ChemicalEntity">dopaminergic</info> agonism. A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">3 mg/kg</info>) and <info type="ChemicalEntity">apomorphine</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">0.5 mg/kg</info>) were given alone or in combination during training and at the <info type="SequenceVariant">10-12h</info> post-training period of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">consolidation</info>. Co-administration of <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">apomorphine</info> during training or <info type="SequenceVariant">10h</info> thereafter produced no significant <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">anti-amnesic effect</info>. However, administration of <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info> during training completely reversed the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">amnesia</info> induced by <info type="ChemicalEntity">apomorphine</info> at the <info type="SequenceVariant">10h</info> post-training time and the converse was also true. These effects were not mediated by a <info type="ChemicalEntity">dopaminergic</info> mechanism as <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info>, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace either <info type="ChemicalEntity">[3H]SCH 23390</info> or <info type="ChemicalEntity">[3H]spiperone</info> binding from <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">D1</info> or <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">D2</info> dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively. It is suggested that <info type="ChemicalEntity">nefiracetam</info> augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">consolidation of memory</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">post-spinal block hypotension</info>. Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OBJECTIVE</info>: To evaluate the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cardiovascular</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">respiratory changes</info> during <info type="ChemicalEntity">unilateral</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional spinal anaesthesia</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">METHODS</info>: With ethical approval, we studied <info type="CellLine">74 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)</info>, physical status class <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">1</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">2</info> patients scheduled for elective <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">unilateral lower limb surgery</info>. Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: <info type="ChemicalEntity">lateral</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional spinal anaesthesia</info> groups. In the <info type="ChemicalEntity">lateral position</info> with operative side down, patients received <info type="ChemicalEntity">10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine</info> through a <info type="ChemicalEntity">25-gauge spinal needle</info>. Patients in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">unilateral group</info> were maintained in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">lateral position</info> for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">15 minutes</info> following spinal injection while those in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional group</info> were turned <info type="ChemicalEntity">supine</info> immediately after injection. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Blood pressure</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">heart rate</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">respiratory rate</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">oxygen saturation</info> were monitored over <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">1 hour</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">RESULTS</info>: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Three patients (8.1%)</info> in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">unilateral group</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">5 (13.5%)</info> in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional group</info> developed <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">P= 0.71</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Four (10.8%)</info> patients in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional group</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">1 (2.7%)</info> in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">unilateral group</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">P= 0.17</info> required <info type="ChemicalEntity">epinephrine infusion</info> to treat <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info>. Patients in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional group</info> had statistically significant greater fall in the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">systolic blood pressures</info> at <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">15</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">30</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">45 minutes</info> when compared to the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">baseline</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">P= 0.003</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">0.001</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">0.004</info>). The mean <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">respiratory rate</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">oxygen saturations</info> in the two groups were similar. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">CONCLUSION</info>: Compared to <info type="ChemicalEntity">conventional spinal anaesthesia</info>, <info type="ChemicalEntity">unilateral spinal anaesthesia</info> was associated with fewer <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cardiovascular perturbations</info>. Also, the type of <info type="ChemicalEntity">spinal block</info> instituted affected neither the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">respiratory rate</info> nor the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">arterial oxygen saturation</info>.

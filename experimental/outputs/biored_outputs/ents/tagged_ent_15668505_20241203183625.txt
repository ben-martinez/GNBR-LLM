<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA2</info> variants and modification of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">breast</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ovarian cancer</info> risk in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> mutation carriers.

The <info type="SequenceVariant">HH</info> genotype of the <info type="SequenceVariant">nonconservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA2</info> gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in risk of both <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">breast</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ovarian cancer</info>. As these studies concerned sporadic <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cancer</info> cases, we investigated whether <info type="SequenceVariant">N372H</info> and another common variant located in the <info type="SequenceVariant">5'-untranslated region (203G > A)</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA2</info> gene modify <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">breast</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ovarian cancer</info> risk in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> mutation carriers. The study includes 778 women carrying a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> germ-line mutation belonging to 403 families. The two <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA2</info> variants were analyzed by the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">TaqMan</info> allelic discrimination technique. Genotypes were analyzed by <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease-free survival</info> analysis using a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Cox proportional hazards</info> model. We found no evidence of a significant modification of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">breast cancer</info> penetrance in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> mutation carriers by either polymorphism. In respect of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ovarian cancer</info> risk, we also saw no effect with the <info type="SequenceVariant">N372H</info> variant but we did observe a borderline association with the <info type="SequenceVariant">5'-untranslated region 203A</info> allele (hazard ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00). In contrast to the result of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Healey</info> et al. on newborn females and adult female controls, we found no departure from <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</info> in the distribution of <info type="SequenceVariant">N372H</info> alleles for our female <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> carriers. We conclude that if these <info type="SequenceVariant">single-nucleotide polymorphisms</info> do modify the risk of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cancer</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRCA1</info> mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly larger than that of <info type="SequenceVariant">N372H</info> previously observed in the general population.

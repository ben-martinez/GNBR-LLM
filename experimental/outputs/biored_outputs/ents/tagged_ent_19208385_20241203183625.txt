<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Osteogenesis imperfecta type III</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">intracranial hemorrhage</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">brachydactyly</info> associated with <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations in exon 49</info> of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">COL1A2</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Osteogenesis imperfecta</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OI</info>) is a heritable bone disorder characterized by <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">fractures</info> with minimal trauma. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Intracranial hemorrhage</info> has been reported in a small number of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OI</info> patients. Here we describe three patients, a boy (aged 15 years) and two girls (aged 17 and 7 years) with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OI type III</info> who suffered <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">intracranial hemorrhage</info> and in addition had <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">brachydactyly</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nail hypoplasia</info>. In all of these patients, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OI</info> was caused by <info type="SequenceVariant">glycine mutations</info> affecting <info type="SequenceVariant">exon 49</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">COL1A2</info> gene, which codes for the most carboxy-terminal part of the triple-helical domain of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">collagen type I alpha 2 chain</info>. These observations suggest that <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> in this region of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">collagen type I alpha 2 chain</info> carry a high risk of abnormal limb development and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">intracranial bleeding</info>.

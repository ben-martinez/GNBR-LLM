<info type="SequenceVariant">Pure monosomy</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">pure trisomy</info> of <info type="SequenceVariant">13q21.2-31.1</info> consequent to a familial <info type="SequenceVariant">insertional translocation</info>: exclusion of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCDH9</info> as the responsible gene for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">AUNA1</info>).

<info type="SequenceVariant">Insertional translocations</info> (<info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info>) are rare structural rearrangements. Offspring of <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info> balanced carriers are at high risk to have either <info type="SequenceVariant">pure partial trisomy</info> or <info type="SequenceVariant">monosomy</info> for the inserted segment as manifested by "pure" phenotypes. We describe an <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info> between chromosomes <info type="SequenceVariant">3</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">13</info> segregating in a three-generation pedigree. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Short tandem repeat</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">STR</info>) segregation analysis and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">array-comparative genomic hybridization</info> were used to define the <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info> as a <info type="SequenceVariant">25.1 Mb</info> segment spanning <info type="SequenceVariant">13q21.2-q31.1</info>. The phenotype of <info type="SequenceVariant">pure monosomy</info> included <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">deafness</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">duodenal stenosis</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">developmental and growth delay</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">vertebral anomalies</info>, and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">facial dysmorphisms</info>; the <info type="SequenceVariant">trisomy</info> was manifested by only minor <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">dysmorphisms</info>. As the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">AUNA1</info> deafness locus on <info type="SequenceVariant">13q14-21</info> overlaps the <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCDH9</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">protocadherin-9</info>) gene region, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCDH9</info> was investigated as a candidate gene for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">deafness</info> in both families. Genotyping of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">STRs</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">single nucleotide polymorphisms</info> defined the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">AUNA1</info> breakpoint as <info type="SequenceVariant">35 kb</info> <info type="SequenceVariant">5'</info> to <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCDH9</info>, with a <info type="SequenceVariant">2.4 Mb</info> area of overlap with the <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info>. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA sequencing</info> of coding regions in the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">AUNA1</info> family and in the retained homologue chromosome in the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">monosomic</info> patient revealed no mutations. We conclude that <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">AUNA1</info> deafness does not share a common etiology with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">deafness</info> associated with <info type="SequenceVariant">monosomy 13q21.2-q31.3</info>; <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">deafness</info> may result from <info type="SequenceVariant">monosomy</info> of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCHD9</info> or another gene in the <info type="SequenceVariant">IT</info>, as has been demonstrated in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">contiguous gene deletion syndromes</info>. Precise characterization of the breakpoints of the <info type="SequenceVariant">translocated region</info> is useful to identify which genes may be contributing to the phenotype, either through <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">haploinsufficiency</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">extra dosage effects</info>, in order to define <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">genotype-phenotype correlations</info>.

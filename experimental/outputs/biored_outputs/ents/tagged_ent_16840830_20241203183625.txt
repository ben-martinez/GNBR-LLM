<info type="SequenceVariant">Two novel mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> gene in subjects with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">multiple endocrine neoplasia-1</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info>) is characterized by <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">parathyroid</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">enteropancreatic endocrine</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pituitary adenomas</info> as well as <info type="SequenceVariant">germline mutation</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> gene. We describe 2 families with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">MEN1</info> with <info type="SequenceVariant">novel mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> gene. One family was of <info type="OrganismTaxon">Turkish</info> origin, and the index patient had <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">primary hyperparathyroidism</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PHPT</info>) plus a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">prolactinoma</info>; three relatives had <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PHPT</info> only. The index patient in the second family was a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">46-yr-old woman</info> of <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> origin living in <info type="OrganismTaxon">Taiwan</info>. This patient presented with a complaint of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">epigastric pain</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">watery diarrhea</info> over the past 3 months, and had undergone <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">subtotal parathyroidectomy</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">enucleation</info> of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pancreatic islet cell tumor</info> about 10 yr before. There was also a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">prolactinoma</info>. <info type="SequenceVariant">Sequence analysis</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> gene from <info type="CellLine">leukocyte genomic DNA</info> revealed <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous mutations</info> in both probands. The <info type="OrganismTaxon">Turkish</info> patient and her affected relatives all had a <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous A to G transition</info> at codon 557 (<info type="SequenceVariant">AAG-->GAG</info>) of exon 10 of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> that results in a replacement of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">lysine</info> by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">glutamic acid</info>. The <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> index patient and one of her siblings had a <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous mutation</info> at codon 418 of exon 9 (<info type="SequenceVariant">GAC-->TAT</info>) that results in a substitution of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">aspartic acid</info> by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">tyrosine</info>. In conclusion, we have identified 2 <info type="SequenceVariant">novel missense mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MEN1</info> gene.

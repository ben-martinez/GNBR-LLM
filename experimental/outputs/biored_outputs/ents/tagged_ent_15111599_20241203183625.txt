<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CRYBA3/A1</info> gene mutation associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">suture-sparing autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract</info>: a novel phenotype.

PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect leading to the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">congenital nuclear cataract</info> affecting a large five-generation <info type="OrganismTaxon">Swiss</info> family. METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. One cortical lens was evaluated by <info type="ChemicalEntity">electron microscopy</info> after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with <info type="ChemicalEntity">short tandem repeat polymorphism</info>. Linkage analysis was performed, and candidate genes were <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PCR</info> amplified and screened for mutations on both strands using <info type="ChemicalEntity">direct sequencing</info>. RESULTS: Affected individuals had a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">congenital nuclear lactescent cataract</info> in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA marker D17S1857</info> (lod score: 3.44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CRYBA3/A1</info>, which maps to the vicinity, revealed an in-frame <info type="SequenceVariant">3-bp deletion in exon 4 (279delGAG)</info>. This mutation involved a deletion of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">glycine-91</info>, cosegregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects from the same ethnic background. <info type="ChemicalEntity">Electron microscopy</info> showed that <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cortical lens fiber morphology</info> was normal. CONCLUSIONS: The <info type="SequenceVariant">DeltaG91 mutation</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CRYBA3/A1</info> is associated with an <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract</info>. A splice mutation (<info type="SequenceVariant">IVS3+1G/A</info>) in this gene has been reported in a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">zonular cataract</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">sutural opacities</info>. These results indicate <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">phenotypic heterogeneity</info> related to mutations in this gene.

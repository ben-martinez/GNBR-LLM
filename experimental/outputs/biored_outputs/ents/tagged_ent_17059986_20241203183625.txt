A novel <info type="SequenceVariant">splicing mutation</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC12A3</info> associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Gitelman syndrome</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">idiopathic intracranial hypertension</info>.

We report a case of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Gitelman syndrome</info> (GS) in a <info type="OrganismTaxon">dizygotic twin</info> who presented at 12 years of age with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">growth delay</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">metabolic alkalosis</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypomagnesemia</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypokalemia</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">inappropriate kaliuresis</info>, and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">idiopathic intracranial hypertension</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bilateral papilledema</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pseudotumor cerebri</info>). The patient, her twin sister, and her mother also presented with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cerebral cavernous malformations</info>. Based on the early onset and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">normocalciuria</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Bartter syndrome</info> was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a <info type="SequenceVariant">compound heterozygote</info> for 2 mutations in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC12A3</info>: a substitution of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">serine</info> by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">leucine</info> at amino acid position 555 (<info type="SequenceVariant">p.Ser555Leu</info>) and a novel <info type="SequenceVariant">guanine to cytosine transition</info> at the 5' splice site of intron 22 (<info type="SequenceVariant">c.2633+1G>C</info>), providing the molecular diagnosis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">GS</info>. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and cosegregated within the family. Analysis of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">complementary DNA</info> showed that the <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C</info> caused the appearance of 2 <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">RNA</info> molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">r.2521_2634del</info>). Supplementation with <info type="ChemicalEntity">potassium</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">magnesium</info> improved clinical symptoms and resulted in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">catch-up growth</info>, but <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">vision</info> remained impaired. Three similar associations of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Bartter syndrome</info>/<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">GS</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pseudotumor cerebri</info> were found in the literature, suggesting that <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">electrolyte abnormalities</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">secondary aldosteronism</info> may have a role in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">idiopathic intracranial hypertension</info>. This study provides further evidence for the phenotypical heterogeneity of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">GS</info> and its association with severe manifestations in children. It also shows the independent segregation of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">familial cavernomatosis</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">GS</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Pheochromocytoma</info> unmasked by <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info>.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pheochromocytoma</info> in a patient treated with <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info>. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info> 100 mg and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info> 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent <info type="ChemicalEntity">nicardipine</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">verapamil</info> treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pheochromocytoma</info>. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pheochromocytoma</info> are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Naranjo probability scale</info> indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info> therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info>- and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info>-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pheochromocytoma</info>. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of <info type="ChemicalEntity">tiapride</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">amisulpride</info>.

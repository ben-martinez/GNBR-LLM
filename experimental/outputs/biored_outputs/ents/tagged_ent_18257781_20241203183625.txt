<info type="SequenceVariant">PKD1 mutation</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">homozygous PKD2 variant</info>: a potential modifier in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</info>.

BACKGROUND: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)</info>, which is caused by mutations in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">polycystins 1 (PC1)</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">2 (PC2)</info>, is one of the most commonly inherited renal diseases, affecting ~1 : 1000 <info type="OrganismTaxon">Caucasians</info>. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened <info type="OrganismTaxon">Greek</info> <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ADPKD</info> patients with the <info type="ChemicalEntity">denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)</info> assay and direct sequencing. RESULTS: We identified a patient homozygous for a nucleotide change <info type="SequenceVariant">c.1445T &gt; G</info>, resulting in a novel homozygous substitution of the non-polar hydrophobic <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">phenylalanine</info> to the polar hydrophilic <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">cysteine</info> in exon 6 at codon 482 (<info type="SequenceVariant">p.F482C</info>) of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PKD2</info> gene and a de-novo <info type="SequenceVariant">PKD1 splice-site variant IVS21-2delAG</info>. We did not find this <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PKD2</info> variant in a screen of 280 chromosomes of healthy subjects, supporting its pathogenicity. The proband's parents did not have the <info type="SequenceVariant">PKD1 mutation</info>. Real-time PCR of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PKD2</info> transcript from a skin biopsy revealed 20-fold higher expression in the patient than in a healthy subject and was higher in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than in those of her heterozygote daughter and a healthy subject. The greater gene expression was also supported by <info type="ChemicalEntity">Western blotting</info>. <info type="CellLine">Inner medullar collecting duct (IMCD)</info> cells transfected with the mutant <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PKD2 mouse gene</info> presented a perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic localization compared with the wild type <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ER</info> localization. Patch-clamping of PBMCs from the <info type="SequenceVariant">p.F482C homozygous</info> and heterozygous subjects revealed lower <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">polycystin-2</info> channel function than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time a patient with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ADPKD</info> who is heterozygous for a de novo <info type="SequenceVariant">PKD1 variant</info> and homozygous for a novel <info type="SequenceVariant">PKD2 mutation</info>.

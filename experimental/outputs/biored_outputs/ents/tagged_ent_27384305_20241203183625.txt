<info type="OrganismTaxon">Male 11b-HSD1 Knockout Mice</info> Fed <info type="ChemicalEntity">Trans-Fats</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">Fructose</info> Are Not Protected From <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Metabolic Syndrome</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NAFLD</info>) defines a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nonalcoholic steatohepatitis</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NASH</info>) and cirrhosis and is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">metabolic syndrome</info>. <info type="ChemicalEntity">Glucocorticoids</info> can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. <info type="ChemicalEntity">Glucocorticoids</info> can be reactivated in liver through <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1</info>) enzyme activity. Inhibition of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1</info> has been suggested as a potential treatment for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NAFLD</info>. To test this, <info type="OrganismTaxon">male mice</info> with global (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1 knockout</info> [<info type="SequenceVariant">KO</info>]) and liver-specific (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">LKO</info>) <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1</info> loss of function were fed the <info type="ChemicalEntity">American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">ALIOS</info>) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NAFLD</info>, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed. Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1KO</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">LKO</info> mice were not protected from systemic <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">metabolic disease</info>. Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NAFLD</info> activity score assessment indicated that levels of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">steatosis</info> were similar between <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1KO</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">LKO</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">control mice</info>. Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1KO</info> but not <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">LKO</info> or <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">control mice</info>, suggestive of a transition to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NASH</info>. This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1-deficient mice</info> are not protected from <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">metabolic disease</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hepatosteatosis</info> in the face of a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NAFLD</info>-inducing diet. However, global deficiency of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1</info> did increase markers of hepatic inflammation and suggests a critical role for <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">11b-HSD1</info> in restraining the transition to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">NASH</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Somatic and gonadal mosaicism</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</info>.

The <info type="SequenceVariant">g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG</info> mutation in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">RPGR</info> gene is the most frequent mutation in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">XLRP</info>). The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">mosaicism</info> in an <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">XLRP</info> family. Eight subjects in the <info type="OrganismTaxon">RP</info> family were recruited. Blood samples were collected for <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> extraction. Haplotype analysis and mutational screening on the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">RPGR</info> gene were performed. Additionally, samples of <info type="CellLine">hair follicles</info> and <info type="CellLine">buccal cells</info> from the mother of the proband were acquired for <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> extraction and molecular analysis. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Phenotype</info> was characterized with routine ophthalmic examination, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Goldmann perimetry</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">electroretinography</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">color fundus photography</info>. A <info type="SequenceVariant">g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG</info> mutation was identified in second- and third-generation patients/carriers. A first-generation female, who was considered to be an obligate carrier, demonstrated a normal <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">phenotype</info> as well as a normal <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genotype</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">lymphocytic DNA</info>, indicating the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">gonadal mosaicism</info>; however, a heterozygous <info type="SequenceVariant">AG-deletion</info> at nucleotide 652 and 653 was identified in the genomic <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> of <info type="CellLine">hair follicles</info>, <info type="CellLine">hair shaft</info>, and <info type="CellLine">buccal cells</info>, indicating that the mutation is <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">somatic</info>. In conclusion, we reported on a family in which an asymptomatic woman with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">somatic-gonadal mosaicism</info> for a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">RPGR</info> gene mutation transmitted the mutation to an asymptomatic daughter and to a son with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">XLRP</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Gonadal mosaicism</info> may be responsible for a proportion of multiplex or simplex <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">RP</info> families, in which more than 50% of all cases of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">RP</info> are found.

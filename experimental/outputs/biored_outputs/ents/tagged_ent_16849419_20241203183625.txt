<info type="SequenceVariant">Intronic deletions</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> gene cause <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypercalciuria</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">CONTEXT</info>: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypercalciuria</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HHRH</info>) is a rare metabolic disorder, characterized by <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypophosphatemia</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">rickets</info>/<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">osteomalacia</info> with increased serum <info type="ChemicalEntity">1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D</info> [<info type="ChemicalEntity">1,25-(OH)(2)D</info>] resulting in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypercalciuria</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">OBJECTIVE</info>: Our objective was to determine whether <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> gene, which encodes <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIc</info>, are responsible for the occurrence of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HHRH</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DESIGN AND SETTING</info>: <info type="SequenceVariant">Mutation analysis</info> of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">exons</info> and adjacent <info type="SequenceVariant">introns</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> gene was conducted at an academic research laboratory and medical center. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS</info>: Members of two unrelated families with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HHRH</info> participated in the study. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">RESULTS</info>: Two affected siblings in one family were <info type="SequenceVariant">homozygous</info> for a <info type="SequenceVariant">101-bp deletion</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">intron 9</info>. Haplotype analysis of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> locus in the family showed that the two deletions are on different haplotypes. An unrelated individual with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HHRH</info> was a <info type="SequenceVariant">compound heterozygote</info> for an <info type="SequenceVariant">85-bp deletion</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">intron 10</info> and a <info type="SequenceVariant">G-to-A substitution</info> at the last nucleotide in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">exon 7</info>. The <info type="SequenceVariant">intron 9 deletion</info> (and likely the other two <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info>) identified in this study causes aberrant <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">RNA splicing</info>. Sequence analysis of the deleted regions revealed the presence of direct repeats of homologous sequences. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">CONCLUSION</info>: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HHRH</info> is caused by <info type="SequenceVariant">biallelic mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> gene. Haplotype analysis suggests that the two <info type="SequenceVariant">intron 9 deletions</info> arose independently. The identification of three independent <info type="SequenceVariant">deletions</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">introns 9</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">10</info> suggests that the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SLC34A3</info> gene may be susceptible to <info type="SequenceVariant">unequal crossing over</info> because of sequence misalignment during meiosis.

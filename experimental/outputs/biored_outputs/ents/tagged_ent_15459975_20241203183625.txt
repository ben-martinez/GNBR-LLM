<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SSH1</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSAP</info>) is an uncommon autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder, characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. Thus far, although two loci for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSAP</info> have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> affected families and localized the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">gene</info> in an 8.0 cM interval defined by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">D12S330</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">D12S354</info> on chromosome 12. Upon screening 30 candidate <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genes</info>, we identified a missense mutation, <info type="SequenceVariant">p.Ser63Asn</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SSH1</info> in one family, a frameshift mutation, <info type="SequenceVariant">p.Ser19CysfsX24</info> in an alternative variant (isoform f) of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SSH1</info> in another family, and a frameshift mutation, <info type="SequenceVariant">p.Pro27ProProfsX54</info> in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSAP</info>. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SSH1</info> encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics. Our data suggested that <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cytoskeleton disorganization</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">epidermal cells</info> is likely associated with the pathogenesis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSAP</info>.

<info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> polymorphisms associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome</info>.

PURPOSE: <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Complement factor I</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CFI</info>) plays an important role in complement activation pathways and is known to affect the development of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">uveitis</info>. The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CFI</info> genetic polymorphisms and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH</info>) <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">syndrome</info>. METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info> and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube. <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> polymorphisms were genotyped using <info type="ChemicalEntity">Sequenom MassARRAY technology</info>. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a <info type="ChemicalEntity">X(2)</info> test. The analyses were stratified for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">recurrent status</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">complicated cataract status</info>, and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">steroid-sensitive status</info>. RESULTS: No significant association was found between <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> polymorphisms and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info>. However, patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">recurrent VKH syndrome</info> had lower frequencies of the <info type="ChemicalEntity">G allele</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">GG homozygosity</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in the frequencies of the <info type="ChemicalEntity">G allele</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">GG homozygosity</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> in patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">complicated cataract</info> compared to the controls (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197-0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135-0.551, respectively). Nevertheless, no significant association with patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">steroid-sensitive statuses</info> was detected for <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-rs7356506</info> polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CFI</info> polymorphisms are not significantly associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info>; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of <info type="SequenceVariant">CFI-7356506</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">VKH syndrome</info> that depends on the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">recurrent status</info> and the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">complicated cataract status</info> but not on the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">steroid-sensitive status</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Bietti crystalline dystrophy</info> patients with <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CYP4V2</info> mutations.

PURPOSE: Mutations of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CYP4V2</info> gene, a novel family member of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">cytochrome P450</info> genes on chromosome 4q35, have recently been identified in patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Bietti crystalline dystrophy</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">BCD</info>). The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">BCD</info> patients from <info type="OrganismTaxon">Singapore</info>, and to characterize their phenotype. METHODS: Nine patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">BCD</info> from six families were recruited into the study. The 11 exons of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CYP4V2</info> gene were amplified from genomic <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> of patients by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">polymerase chain reaction</info> and then sequenced. Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed with <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">fundal photography</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">visual field testing</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">fundal fluorescein angiography</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">electroretinography</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">ERG</info>). RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, <info type="SequenceVariant">S482X</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">K386T</info>, were novel and found in three patients. The third mutation, a previously identified <info type="SequenceVariant">15-bp deletion</info> that included the 3' splice site for exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state. Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7. Clinical heterogeneity was present in the patients. Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 seemed to have more severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease</info> compared to patients homozygous for the deletion. There was good correlation between clinical stage of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ERG</info> changes, but age did not correlate with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease severity</info>. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel mutations in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CYP4V2</info> gene as a cause of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">BCD</info>. A high carrier frequency for the <info type="SequenceVariant">15-bp deletion</info> in exon 7 may exist in the <info type="OrganismTaxon">Singapore</info> population. Phenotype characterization showed clinical heterogeneity, and age did not correlate with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease severity</info>.

        "title": "Both the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) kinase inhibitory region and SOCS-1 mimetic bind to JAK2 autophosphorylation site: implications for the development of a SOCS-1 antagonist", 
        "abstract": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 protein modulates signaling by IFN-gamma by binding to the autophosphorylation site of JAK2 and by targeting bound JAK2 to the proteosome for degradation. We have developed a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor peptide (Tkip) that is a SOCS-1 mimetic. Tkip is compared in this study with the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) of SOCS-1 for JAK2 recognition, inhibition of kinase activity, and regulation of IFN-gamma-induced biological activity. Tkip and a peptide corresponding to the KIR of SOCS-1, ((53))DTHFRTFRSHSDYRRI((68)) (SOCS1-KIR), both bound similarly to the autophosphorylation site of JAK2, JAK2(1001-1013). The peptides also bound to JAK2 peptide phosphorylated at Tyr(1007), pJAK2(1001-1013). Dose-response competitions suggest that Tkip and SOCS1-KIR similarly recognize the autophosphorylation site of JAK2, but probably not precisely the same way. Although Tkip inhibited JAK2 autophosphorylation as well as IFN-gamma-induced STAT1-alpha phosphorylation, SOCS1-KIR, like SOCS-1, did not inhibit JAK2 autophosphorylation but inhibited STAT1-alpha activation. Both Tkip and SOCS1-KIR inhibited IFN-gamma activation of Raw 264.7 murine macrophages and inhibited Ag-specific splenocyte proliferation. The fact that SOCS1-KIR binds to pJAK2(1001-1013) suggests that the JAK2 peptide could function as an antagonist of SOCS-1. Thus, pJAK2(1001-1013) enhanced suboptimal IFN-gamma activity, blocked SOCS-1-induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in IL-6-treated cells, enhanced IFN-gamma activation site promoter activity, and enhanced Ag-specific proliferation. Furthermore, SOCS-1 competed with SOCS1-KIR for pJAK2(1001-1013). Thus, the KIR region of SOCS-1 binds directly to the autophosphorylation site of JAK2 and a peptide corresponding to this site can function as an antagonist of SOCS-1.",

        "title": "Apo B100 similarities to viral proteins suggest basis for LDL-DNA binding and transfection capacity", 
        "abstract": "LDL mediates transfection with plasmid DNA in a variety of cell types in vitro and in several tissues in vivo in the rat. The transfection capacity of LDL is based on apo B100, as arginine/lysine clusters, suggestive of nucleic acid-binding domains and nuclear localization signal sequences, are present throughout the molecule. Apo E may also contribute to this capacity because of its similarity to the Dengue virus capsid proteins and its ability to bind DNA. Synthetic peptides representing two apo B100 regions with prominent Arg/Lys clusters were shown to bind DNA. Region 1 (0014Lys-Ser0160) shares sequence motifs present in DNA binding domains of Interferon Regulatory Factors and Flaviviridae capsid/core proteins. It also contains a close analog of the B/E receptor ligand of apo E. Region 1 peptides, B1-1 (0014Lys-Glu0054) and B1-2 (0055Leu-Ala0096), mediate transfection of HeLa cells but are cytotoxic. Region 2 (3313Asp-Thr3431), containing the known B/E receptor ligand, shares analog motifs with the human herpesvirus 5 immediate-early transcriptional regulator (UL122) and Flaviviridae NS3 helicases. Region 2 peptides, B2-1 (3313Asp-Glu3355), and B2-2 (3356Gly-Thr3431) are ineffective in cell transfection and are noncytotoxic. These results confirm the role of LDL as a natural transfection vector in vivo, a capacity imparted by the apo B100, and suggest a basis for Flaviviridae cell entry.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) are the precursors of at least 15% of colorectal carcinomas, but their biology is incompletely understood. We performed a clinicopathological and molecular analysis of a large number of the rarely observed SSAs with dysplasia/carcinoma to better define their features and the pathways by which they progress to carcinoma. Design: A cross-sectional analysis of 137 SSAs containing regions of dysplasia/carcinoma prospectively collected at a community GI pathology practice was conducted. Samples were examined for BRAF and KRAS mutations, the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and immunostained for MLH1, p53, p16, β-catenin and 0-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Results: The median polyp size was 9 mm and 86.5% were proximal. Most were BRAF mutated (92.7%) and 94.0% showed CIMP. Mismatch repair deficiency, evidenced by loss of MLH1 (74.5%) is associated with older age (76.7 versus 71.0; p<0.0029), female gender (70% versus 36%; p<0.0008), proximal location (91% versus 72%; p<0.02), CIMP (98% versus 80%; p<0.02) and lack of aberrant p53 (7% versus 34%; p<0.001) when compared with the mismatch repair-proficient cases. Loss of p16 (43.1%) and gain of nuclear β-catenin (55.5%) were common in areas of dysplasia/cancer, irrespective of mismatch repair status. Conclusions: SSAs containing dysplasia/carcinoma are predominantly small (<10 mm) and proximal. The mismatch repair status separates these lesions into distinct clinicopathological subgroups, although WNT activation and p16 silencing are common to both. Cases with dysplasia occur at a similar age to cases with carcinoma. This, together with the rarity of these 'caught in the act' lesions, suggests a rapid transition to malignancy following a long dwell time as an SSA without dysplasia.

        "title": "[Cellular markers based on DNA damage and repair (BER, MMR), expression of MLHI, MSH2, FasR, and cell death of lymphocytes as predictive parameters for clinical response to chemotherapy of melanoma]", 
        "abstract": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive neoplastic disease attributed to transformed melanocytes. The efficacy of regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced stage patients does not exceed 20%. Search for lymphocyte markers of patients' sensitivity to chemotherapy provides a rational basis for development of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Using blood lymphocytes we evaluated efficacy of BER and MMR, expression of MLH1, MSH2 and FasR, and cell death in melanoma patients relative to clinical response to chemotherapy. We found that LDCI-chemotherapy (lomustine, dacarbazine, cisplatin and interferon gamma), induced AP sites and DNA ss-breaks which repaired trough BER pathway. However, neither initial DNA damage nor the rate of their repair correlated with clinical response. This result prompts us to think that this type of damage is not crucial in cytotoxic effect of LDCI-regimen of chemotherapy. DNA ds-breakes appeared downstream ss-breakes were attributed to repair of 06-methylguanine by MMR mechanism in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. The number of ds-breakes appeared by 48 correlated with positive clinical response of patients to chemotherapy. The same link was observed between clinical response and the number of dead lymphocytes. However, there was no correlation between clinical response and expression of MLHI + MSH2 and FasR. These results imply possible contribution of crosslink repair through NER pathway to formation of DNA ds-breaks as well as to cytotoxicity of LDCl-therapy. The observed link between high level of secondary ds-breaks and positive response to chemotherapy indicates the potential of these instruments to serve as prognostic end point in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The effect of a battery of CD1 mAb on intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and IL-2 production has been examined on different T cell lines in this study. Both 0249F and NU-T2 two CD1b specific mAb tested, induced a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration on HPBALL T cells whereas only one (L161) among three different CD1c mAb (L161, 10C3, and M241) produced a similar effect. In contrast the addition of four different CD1a mAb directed against two different epitopic groups of this molecule were uneffective in modifying the intracellular Ca2+. Both L161 and 0249F also induced a comparable increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration on MOLT 4 and JURKAT, two other T cell lines of similar phenotype. The effect of L161 mAb on the IL-2 production of the IL-2 producing T cell line JURKAT was also examined. The association of the latter with PMA strongly induced the production of IL-2 on this cell model while either L161 or PMA alone had no effect. Although the natural ligand and the function of CD1 molecules are still unknown, the accumulation of these data strongly suggest that CD1b and CD1c might represent two activatory pathways for immature T cells operating before the classical CD2 and CD3 activation pathways.",

        "title": "Expression, purification, and enzymatic properties of recombinant human cytochrome P450c27 (CYP27)", 
        "abstract": "A large number of microsomal P450s have been expressed in Escherichia coli in quantities sufficient for structure/function analysis. However, only one mitochondrial P450 has been successfully overexpressed, that being cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc). We report here overexpression, purification, and characterization of a second mitochondrial P450, human sterol C-27 hydroxylase (P450c27). The conditions used for expression are very similar to those applied for P450scc, although a quite different purification protocol was necessary to achieve highly purified P450c27. The catalytic properties of purified recombinant human P450c27 resemble those of purified, endogenous rat and rabbit P450c27, regarding both specificity and turnover numbers. Like endogenous P450c27 from rat and rabbit liver, human recombinant P450c27 is only functional in the presence of adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase and shows no activity in the presence of the microsomal P450 reductase. We conclude that P450c27 is most likely not the 1alpha-hydroxylase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, contrary to a previous suggestion (Axen, E., Postlind, H., Sjöberg, H., and Wikvall, K. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 10014-10018) because this activity of P450c27 (28 pmol/min/nmol P450) seems far too low to be physiologically relevant. This activity is 10(3) times lower than the 27-hydroxylase activity toward 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol and 40 times lower than the 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol by this enzyme. The development of this expression system and purification procedure creates the potential for structure/function analysis of P450c27, including possible crystallization of this important enzyme.",

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Urinary bladder cancer</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>: risks and relation to <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info>.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info>, and its relation to <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info>, in patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>. METHODS: In the population based, nationwide <info type="OrganismTaxon">Swedish</info> Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the <info type="OrganismTaxon">Swedish</info> Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> after <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>, and the relative prevalence of a history of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> at the time of diagnosis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info> among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> doubled for every 10 g increment in <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info> (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>, and a history of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info> was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between <info type="ChemicalEntity">cyclophosphamide</info> and the risk of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bladder cancer</info>, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Wegener's granulomatosis</info>.

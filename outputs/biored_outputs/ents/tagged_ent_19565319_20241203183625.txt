<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A)</info> variants may increase <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autistic symptoms</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">anxiety</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autism spectrum disorder</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)</info> are heterogeneous disorders presenting with increased rates of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">anxiety</info>. The <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A)</info> is associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">panic disorder</info> and is located on <info type="SequenceVariant">chromosome 22q11.23</info>. Its gene product, the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">adenosine A(2A) receptor</info>, is strongly expressed in the <info type="OrganismTaxon">caudate nucleus</info>, which also is involved in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ASD</info>. As <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">autistic symptoms</info> are increased in individuals with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">22q11.2 deletion syndrome</info>, and large <info type="SequenceVariant">22q11.2 deletions</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">duplications</info> have been observed in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ASD</info> individuals, in this study, <info type="OrganismTaxon">98 individuals with ASD</info> and <info type="OrganismTaxon">234 control individuals</info> were genotyped for <info type="SequenceVariant">eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ADORA2A</info>. Nominal association with the disorder was observed for <info type="SequenceVariant">rs2236624-CC</info>, and phenotypic variability in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ASD symptoms</info> was influenced by <info type="SequenceVariant">rs3761422</info>, <info type="SequenceVariant">rs5751876</info> and <info type="SequenceVariant">rs35320474</info>. In addition, association of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ADORA2A</info> variants with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">anxiety</info> was replicated for individuals with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ASD</info>. Findings point toward a possible mediating role of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ADORA2A</info> variants on phenotypic expression in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ASD</info> that need to be replicated in a larger sample.

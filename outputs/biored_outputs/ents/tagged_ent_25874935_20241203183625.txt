<info type="ChemicalEntity">Neuroserpin</info> (NSP) reportedly exerts <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotective effects</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cerebral ischemic</info> animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood. We thus attempted to confirm <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotective effects</info> of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> on <info type="CellLine">astrocytes</info> in the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ischemic</info> state and then explored the relative mechanisms. <info type="CellLine">Astrocytes</info> from <info type="OrganismTaxon">neonatal rats</info> were treated with <info type="ChemicalEntity">oxygen-glucose deprivation</info> (OGD) followed by <info type="ChemicalEntity">reoxygenation</info> (OGD/R). To confirm the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotective effects</info> of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info>, we measured the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cell survival rate</info>, relative <info type="ChemicalEntity">lactate dehydrogenase</info> (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely <info type="ChemicalEntity">Hoechst 33342</info> staining and <info type="ChemicalEntity">Annexin V</info> assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info>, the release of <info type="ChemicalEntity">nitric oxide</info> (NO) and <info type="ChemicalEntity">TNF-alpha</info> related to <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> administration were measured by <info type="ChemicalEntity">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</info>. The proteins related to the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NF-kappaB</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ERK1/2</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PI3K/Akt</info> pathways were investigated by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Western blotting</info>. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotection</info> and the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NF-kappaB</info> pathway, a <info type="ChemicalEntity">NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060</info> was employed to observe the effects of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info>-induced <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotection</info>. We found that <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> significantly increased the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cell survival rate</info> and reduced <info type="ChemicalEntity">LDH</info> release in OGD/R-treated <info type="CellLine">astrocytes</info>. It also reduced <info type="ChemicalEntity">NO</info>/<info type="ChemicalEntity">TNF-alpha</info> release. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Western blotting</info> showed that the protein levels of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">p-IKKBalpha/beta</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">P65</info> were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> administration. The <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info>-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the <info type="ChemicalEntity">NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060</info>, whereas, expressions of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">p-ERK1</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">p-ERK2</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">p-AKT</info> were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> administration. Our results thus verified the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neuroprotective effects</info> of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> in <info type="CellLine">ischemic astrocytes</info>. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of <info type="ChemicalEntity">NO</info>/<info type="ChemicalEntity">TNF-alpha</info> and repression of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NF-kappaB</info> signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that <info type="ChemicalEntity">NSP</info> has little influence on the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MAPK</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">PI3K/Akt</info> pathways.

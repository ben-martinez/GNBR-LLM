<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FOXF2</info> in patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disorders of sex development</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSD</info>) in combination with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cleft palate</info>.

In contrast to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disorders of sexual differentiation</info> caused by lack of <info type="ChemicalEntity">androgen</info> production or inhibited <info type="ChemicalEntity">androgen</info> action, defects affecting development of the bipotent genital anlagen have rarely been investigated in <info type="OrganismTaxon">humans</info>. We have previously documented that the transcription factor <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FOXF2</info> is highly expressed in <info type="OrganismTaxon">human</info> foreskin. Moreover, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Foxf2</info> knockout <info type="OrganismTaxon">mice</info> present with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cleft palate</info> in combination with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypoplasia</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genital tubercle</info>. We hypothesized that <info type="OrganismTaxon">humans</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disorders of sex development</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSD</info>) in combination with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cleft palate</info> could have mutations in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FOXF2</info> gene. Eighteen children with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSD</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">cleft palate</info> were identified in the <info type="OrganismTaxon">L beck</info> <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">DSD</info> database (about 1,500 entries). Genomic <info type="ChemicalEntity">DNA</info> sequence analysis of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FOXF2</info> gene was performed and compared with 10 normal female and 10 normal male controls, respectively. Two <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous DNA sequence variations</info> were solely present in one single patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of <info type="SequenceVariant">GCC</info> (c.97<info type="SequenceVariant">GCC[9]+[10]</info>) resulting in an extra <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">alanine</info> within exon 1 and a <info type="SequenceVariant">25*G>A</info> substitution in the <info type="ChemicalEntity">3'-untranslated region</info>. Two patients carried a <info type="SequenceVariant">c.262G>A</info> sequence variation predicting for an <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Ala88Thr</info> exchange which was also detected in 2 normal controls. Two silent mutations, <info type="SequenceVariant">c.1272C>T</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Ser424Ser</info>) and <info type="SequenceVariant">c.1284T>C</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Tyr428Tyr</info>), respectively, occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in both patients and normal controls. In conclusion, the majority of the detected <info type="SequenceVariant">sequence alterations</info> were <info type="SequenceVariant">polymorphisms</info> without obvious functional relevance. However, it cannot be excluded that the 2 unique <info type="SequenceVariant">DNA sequence alterations</info> could have affected <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FOXF2</info> on the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">mRNA</info> or <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">protein</info> level thus contributing to the observed disturbances in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">genital</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">palate development</info>.

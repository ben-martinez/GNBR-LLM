<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">endoglin</info> gene polymorphism and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">systemic sclerosis</info>-related <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pulmonary arterial hypertension</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Systemic sclerosis</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info>) is a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">connective tissue disorder</info> characterized by early generalized <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">microangiopathy</info> with disturbed <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">angiogenesis</info>. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Endoglin</info> gene (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ENG</info>) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which acts as an accessory receptor for the <info type="ChemicalEntity">transforming growth factor-beta</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">TGF-beta</info>) superfamily, and is crucial for maintaining <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">vascular integrity</info>. A <info type="SequenceVariant">6-base insertion</info> in intron 7 (<info type="SequenceVariant">6bINS</info>) of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ENG</info> has been reported to be associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">microvascular disturbance</info>. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between <info type="SequenceVariant">6bINS</info> and the vascular complication <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">pulmonary arterial hypertension</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info>) in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> in a <info type="OrganismTaxon">French Caucasian</info> population. METHODS: Two hundred eighty <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> cases containing 29/280 having <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info> diagnosed by catheterism were compared with 140 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">osteoarthritis</info>. Genotyping was performed by polymerase-chain-reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: The polymorphism was in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Hardy-Weinberg</info> equilibrium. We observed a significant lower frequency of <info type="SequenceVariant">6bINS</info> allele in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> patients with associated <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info> compared with controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (<info type="ChemicalEntity">OR</info>) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (<info type="ChemicalEntity">CI</info>) 0.15-0.89], and a trend in comparison with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> patients without <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info> (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; <info type="ChemicalEntity">OR</info>: 0.45, 95% <info type="ChemicalEntity">CI</info>: 0.19-1.08). Genotypes carrying allele <info type="SequenceVariant">6bINS</info> were also less frequent in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info> than in controls (20.7 vs 42.9%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Thus the frequency of <info type="SequenceVariant">6bINS</info> differs between <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info> patients with or without <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PAH</info>, suggesting the implication of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ENG</info> in this devastating vascular complication of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">SSc</info>.

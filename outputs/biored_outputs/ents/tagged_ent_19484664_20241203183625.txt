<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Angiotensin converting enzyme</info> <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">gene</info> polymorphism in <info type="OrganismTaxon">Turkish</info> <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatic</info> patients.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Asthma</info> is a chronic inflammatory <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease</info> of the airways. Several candidate <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genes</info> have been identified with a potential role in the pathogenesis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthma</info>, including the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)</info> <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">gene</info>. We aimed to investigate the frequency of an <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ACE</info> <info type="SequenceVariant">gene polymorphism</info> in <info type="OrganismTaxon">Turkish</info> <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatic</info> patients and to determine its impact on clinical parameters and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease severity</info>. Ninety-seven <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatic</info> patients (M/F 25/72, mean age 39 +/- 13 years) and 96 healthy subjects (M/F 26/70, mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were included. At baseline, all participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, symptoms, triggering factors, severity of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthma</info>, and the presence of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">atopism</info>. Blood samples were obtained from all patients and genomic <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> was isolated. The frequency of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ACE</info> <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genotypes</info> (I = insertion and D = deletion) among <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatics</info> and controls were compared: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatics</info> showed a 40.2% prevalence of the <info type="SequenceVariant">DD genotype</info> (n = 39), <info type="SequenceVariant">ID</info> was 45.4% (n = 44), and <info type="SequenceVariant">II</info> was 14.4% (n = 14.4). In the control subjects, the frequency of <info type="SequenceVariant">DD</info> was 18.8% (n = 18), <info type="SequenceVariant">ID</info> was 50% (n = 48) and <info type="SequenceVariant">II</info> was 31.3% (n = 30). The <info type="SequenceVariant">DD ACE genotype</info> was significantly more frequent in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatics</info> compared with controls (p < 0.001). <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Asthmatics</info> with the <info type="SequenceVariant">ID ACE genotype</info> showed a higher frequency of drug allergies, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Asthmatics</info> with the <info type="SequenceVariant">DD genotype</info> appeared to have a higher incidence of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatic episode exacerbations</info> due to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">viral infections</info>, but again this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Patients with mild or moderate-severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthma</info> had similar frequencies of these mutations. We found a higher frequency of the <info type="SequenceVariant">ACE DD gene mutation</info> in <info type="OrganismTaxon">Turkish</info> <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatic</info> patients compared with non-<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthmatics</info>, suggesting that this <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ACE gene polymorphism</info> may be a risk factor for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">asthma</info> but does not increase the severity of the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease</info>.

A novel <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">SCN5A</info> mutation manifests as a malignant form of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">long QT syndrome</info> with perinatal onset of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">tachycardia</info>/<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info>.

OBJECTIVE: Congenital <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">long QT syndrome</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">LQTS</info>) with in utero onset of the rhythm disturbances is associated with a poor prognosis. In this study we investigated a newborn patient with fetal <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info>, 2:1 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">atrioventricular block</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ventricular tachycardia</info> soon after birth. METHODS: Mutational analysis and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> sequencing were conducted in a newborn. The 2:1 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">atrioventricular block</info> improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous <info type="ChemicalEntity">lidocaine</info> infusion or a high dose of <info type="ChemicalEntity">mexiletine</info>, which also controlled the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ventricular tachycardia</info>. RESULTS: A novel, spontaneous <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">LQTS-3</info> mutation was identified in the transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Na(v)1.5</info> cardiac sodium channel, with a <info type="SequenceVariant">G-->A</info> substitution at codon 1763, which changed a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">valine</info> (<info type="SequenceVariant">GTG</info>) to a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">methionine</info> (<info type="SequenceVariant">ATG</info>). The proband was <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygous</info> but the mutation was absent in the parents and the sister. Expression of this mutant channel in <info type="CellLine">tsA201</info> mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent <info type="ChemicalEntity">tetrodotoxin</info>-sensitive but <info type="ChemicalEntity">lidocaine</info>-resistant current that was associated with a positive shift of the steady-state inactivation curve, steeper activation curve and faster recovery from inactivation. We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring <info type="SequenceVariant">V1764M</info> mutant. But, the other neighboring <info type="SequenceVariant">I1762A</info> mutant had no persistent current and was still associated with a positive shift of inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Na(v)1.5</info>/<info type="SequenceVariant">V1763M</info> channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to a persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">LQTS</info> with perinatal onset of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">arrhythmias</info> that responded to <info type="ChemicalEntity">lidocaine</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">mexiletine</info>.

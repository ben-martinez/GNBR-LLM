<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF</info> as a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info>/<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nevus</info> susceptibility <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">gene</info>.

Somatic <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF</info> have been identified in both <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info> tumors and benign <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nevi</info>. Germ line <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF</info> have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info>. However, a recent study suggested that a <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF</info> <info type="SequenceVariant">haplotype</info> was associated with risk of sporadic <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info> in men. <info type="SequenceVariant">Polymorphisms</info> or other <info type="SequenceVariant">variants</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF</info> <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">gene</info> may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genes</info> for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nevus</info>/<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info> susceptibility. We hypothesized that <info type="SequenceVariant">promoter variants</info> would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using <info type="ChemicalEntity">denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">sequencing</info>, we screened peripheral blood <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> from <info type="SequenceVariant">184 familial melanoma cases</info> for <info type="SequenceVariant">BRAF promoter variants</info>. We identified a <info type="SequenceVariant">promoter insertion/deletion</info> in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described <info type="SequenceVariant">BRAF polymorphism</info> in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">intron 11</info> (<info type="SequenceVariant">rs1639679</info>) reported to be associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma susceptibility</info> in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this <info type="SequenceVariant">BRAF polymorphism</info> to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma susceptibility</info> in <info type="SequenceVariant">581 consecutively recruited incident cases</info>, <info type="SequenceVariant">258 incident cases</info> in a study of late relapse, <info type="SequenceVariant">673 female general practitioner controls</info>, and the <info type="SequenceVariant">184 familial cases</info>. We found no statistically significant difference in either <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">genotype</info> or <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">allele frequencies</info> between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the <info type="SequenceVariant">BRAF polymorphism</info> in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the <info type="SequenceVariant">BRAF polymorphism</info> is not significantly associated with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">melanoma</info> and the <info type="SequenceVariant">promoter insertion/deletion</info> linked with the <info type="SequenceVariant">polymorphism</info> is not a causal <info type="SequenceVariant">variant</info>. In addition, we found that there was no association between the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BRAF genotype</info> and mean total number of banal or atypical <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">nevi</info> in either the cases or controls.

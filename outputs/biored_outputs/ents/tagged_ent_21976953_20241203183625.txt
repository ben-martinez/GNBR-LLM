<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info> gene mutation in a <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> family with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Marfan syndrome</info>.

PURPOSE: To identify the mutation in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">fibrillin-1 gene</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info>) in a <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> family with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Marfan syndrome</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">MFS</info>). METHODS: Patients and family members were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of six individuals in the family and 170 healthy <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> individuals. All of the 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info> were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. The mutation identified in the proband was screened in the other family members and the 170 healthy <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> individuals by direct sequencing. Protein conservation analysis was performed in six species using an online <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">ClustalW</info> tool. Protein structure was modeled based on the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Protein data bank</info> and mutated in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DeepView v4.0.1</info> to predict the functional consequences of the mutation. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous <info type="SequenceVariant">c.3703T&gt;C</info> change in exon 29 of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info> was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">serine</info> by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">proline</info> at codon 1235 (<info type="SequenceVariant">p.S1235P</info>). This mutation was also present in two family members but absent in the other, unaffected family members and the 170 healthy <info type="OrganismTaxon">Chinese</info> individuals. The mutant residue located in the calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like#15 domain is highly conserved among <info type="OrganismTaxon">mammalian species</info> and could probably induce conformation change of the domain. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel <info type="SequenceVariant">p.S1235P</info> mutation in <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info>, which is the causative mutation for <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">MFS</info> in this family. Our result expands the mutation spectrum of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FBN1</info> and contributes to the study of the molecular pathogenesis of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Marfan syndrome</info>.

<info type="ChemicalEntity">lamivudine</info> resistance mutations in <info type="OrganismTaxon">Brazilian</info> patients co-infected with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HIV</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hepatitis B</info>. 

This study analyzed the genotype distribution and frequency of <info type="ChemicalEntity">lamivudine</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info>) and <info type="ChemicalEntity">tenofovir</info> (<info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info>) resistance mutations in a group of patients co-infected with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HIV</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hepatitis B virus</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBV</info>). A cross-sectional study of 847 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HIV</info> was conducted. Patients provided blood samples for <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBsAg</info> detection. The load of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBV</info> was determined using an "in-house" real-time polymerase chain reaction. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBV</info> genotypes/subgenotypes, antiviral resistance, basal core promoter (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BCP</info>), and precore mutations were detected by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">DNA</info> sequencing. Twenty-eight patients with co-infection were identified. The distribution of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBV</info> genotypes among these patients was A (n = 9; 50%), D (n = 4; 22.2%), G (n = 3; 16.7%), and F (n = 2; 11.1%). Eighteen patients were treated with <info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info> and six patients were treated with <info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info> plus <info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info>. The length of exposure to <info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info> varied from 4 to 216 months. <info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info> resistance substitutions (<info type="SequenceVariant">rtL180M</info> + <info type="SequenceVariant">rtM204V</info>) were detected in 10 (50%) of the 20 patients with viremia. This pattern and an accompanying <info type="SequenceVariant">rtV173L</info> mutation was found in four patients. Three patients with the triple polymerase substitution pattern (<info type="SequenceVariant">rtV173L</info> + <info type="SequenceVariant">rtL180M</info> + <info type="SequenceVariant">rtM204V</info>) had associated changes in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">envelope gene</info> (<info type="SequenceVariant">sE164D</info> + <info type="SequenceVariant">sI195M</info>). Mutations in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BCP</info> region (<info type="SequenceVariant">A1762T</info>, <info type="SequenceVariant">G1764A</info>) and in the precore region (<info type="SequenceVariant">G1896A</info>, <info type="SequenceVariant">G1899A</info>) were also found. No putative <info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info> resistance substitution was detected. The data suggest that prolonged <info type="ChemicalEntity">LAM</info> use is associated with the emergence of particular changes in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">HBV</info> genome, including substitutions that may elicit a vaccine escape phenotype. No putative <info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info> resistance change was detected after prolonged use of <info type="ChemicalEntity">TDF</info>.

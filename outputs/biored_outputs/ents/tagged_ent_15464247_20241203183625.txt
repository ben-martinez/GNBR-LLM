<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">interleukin 12B</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info>) polymorphisms on spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hepatitis C virus infection</info>.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">Interleukin-12</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL-12</info>) governs the <info type="OrganismTaxon">Th1-type</info> immune response, affecting the spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV-infection</info>. We investigated whether the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> polymorphisms within the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which have been reported to influence <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL-12</info> synthesis, are associated with the outcome of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV infection</info>. METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV clearance</info>, 501 chronically <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV infected</info> patients, and 217 healthy controls. <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> 3'-UTR and promoter genotyping was performed by <info type="ChemicalEntity">Taqman-based assays</info> with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and <info type="ChemicalEntity">PCR-based allele-specific DNA-amplification</info>, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts. However, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV</info> genotype 1-infected patients with high baseline viremia carrying the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele showed significantly higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates (25.3% vs. 46% vs. 54.5% for A/A, A/C and C/C) due to reduced relapse rates (24.2% vs. 12% vs. zero % for A/A, A/C and C/C). CONCLUSIONS: <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele carriers appear to be capable of responding more efficiently to <info type="ChemicalEntity">antiviral combination therapy</info> as a consequence of a reduced relapse rate. No association of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">IL12B</info> polymorphisms and self-limited <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">HCV infection</info> could be demonstrated.

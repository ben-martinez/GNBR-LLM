<info type="ChemicalEntity">Array-based comparative genomic hybridization</info> analysis reveals recurrent chromosomal alterations and prognostic parameters in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma</info>.

<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PURPOSE</info>: To evaluate the clinical relevance of genomic aberrations in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>). <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PATIENTS AND METHODS</info>: Skin biopsy samples of 31 patients with a <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info> classified as either <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCFCL</info>; n = 19) or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type (n = 12), according to the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">WHO-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">EORTC</info>) classification, were investigated using <info type="ChemicalEntity">array-based comparative genomic hybridization</info>, <info type="ChemicalEntity">fluorescence in situ hybridization</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FISH</info>), and examination of <info type="ChemicalEntity">promoter hypermethylation</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">RESULTS</info>: The most recurrent alterations in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCFCL</info> were high-level <info type="ChemicalEntity">DNA amplifications</info> at <info type="SequenceVariant">2p16.1</info> (63%) and deletion of chromosome <info type="SequenceVariant">14q32.33</info> (68%). <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FISH</info> analysis confirmed <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">c-REL</info> amplification in patients with gains at <info type="SequenceVariant">2p16.1</info>. In <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type, most prominent aberrations were a high-level <info type="ChemicalEntity">DNA amplification</info> of <info type="SequenceVariant">18q21.31-q21.33</info> (67%), including the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">BCL-2</info> and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">MALT1</info> genes as confirmed by <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">FISH</info>, and deletions of a small region within <info type="SequenceVariant">9p21.3</info> containing the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CDKN2A</info>, <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CDKN2B</info>, and <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NSG-x</info> genes. Homozygous deletion of <info type="SequenceVariant">9p21.3</info> was detected in five of 12 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type, but in zero of 19 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCFCL</info>. Complete methylation of the promoter region of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CDKN2A</info> gene was demonstrated in one <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type, patient with hemizygous deletion, in one patient without deletion, but in zero of 19 patients with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCFCL</info>. Seven of seven <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type, patients with deletion of <info type="SequenceVariant">9p21.3</info> and/or complete methylation of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CDKN2A</info> died as a result of their <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">lymphoma</info>. <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">CONCLUSION</info>: Our results demonstrate prominent differences in chromosomal alterations between <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCFCL</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type, that support their classification as separate entities within the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">WHO-EORTC</info> scheme. Inactivation of <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">CDKN2A</info> by either deletion or methylation of its promoter could be an important prognostic parameter for the group of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">PCLBCL</info>, leg type.

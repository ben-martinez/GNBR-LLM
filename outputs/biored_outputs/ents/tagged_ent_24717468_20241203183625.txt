A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between <info type="ChemicalEntity">dexmedetomidine</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info> for sedation in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neurocritical care</info> patients.

OBJECTIVE: <info type="ChemicalEntity">Dexmedetomidine</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info> are commonly used sedatives in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neurocritical care</info> as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations. However, both agents are associated with significant <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hemodynamic side effects</info>. The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hemodynamic effects</info> in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neurocritical care</info> patients receiving <info type="ChemicalEntity">dexmedetomidine</info> and <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info>. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Neurocritical care</info> units at two academic medical centers with dedicated <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neurocritical care</info> teams and board-certified <info type="OrganismTaxon">neurointensivists</info>. PATIENTS: <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Neurocritical care</info> patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1:1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous sedation with <info type="ChemicalEntity">dexmedetomidine</info> or <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info>. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 342 patients (105 <info type="ChemicalEntity">dexmedetomidine</info> and 237 <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info>) were included in the analysis, with 190 matched (95 in each group) by propensity score. The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info> (mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info> (heart rate < 50 beats/min) during sedative infusion. No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched (30% vs 30%, p = 0.94) or matched cohorts (28% vs 34%, p = 0.35) could be found. When analyzed separately, no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info> in either the unmatched or matched cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info> occur at similar prevalence in <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">neurocritical care</info> patients who receive <info type="ChemicalEntity">dexmedetomidine</info> or <info type="ChemicalEntity">propofol</info>. Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">hypotension</info> or <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">bradycardia</info> before starting either sedative.

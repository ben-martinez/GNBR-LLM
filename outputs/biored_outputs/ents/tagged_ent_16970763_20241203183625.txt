<info type="SequenceVariant">Mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info> gene: contribution to <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">retinopathy of prematurity</info>. 

BACKGROUND: To examine the contribution of <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> within the <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info> (<info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info>) gene to the clinically similar retinal diseases <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">FEVR</info>), <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Coat's disease</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">retinopathy of prematurity</info> (<info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ROP</info>). METHODS: A dataset comprising 13 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie-FEVR</info>, one <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Coat's disease</info>, 31 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ROP</info> patients and 90 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ex-premature</info> babies of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">&lt;32 weeks' gestation</info> underwent an ophthalmologic examination and were screened for <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> within the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info> gene by direct DNA sequencing, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or gel electrophoresis. Controls were only screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Confirmation of <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> identified was obtained by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Evidence for two novel <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info> gene was presented: <info type="SequenceVariant">Leu103Val</info> in one <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">FEVR</info> patient and <info type="SequenceVariant">His43Arg</info> in monozygotic twin <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info> patients. Furthermore, a previously described <info type="SequenceVariant">14-bp deletion</info> located in the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">5' unstranslated region</info> of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info> gene was detected in three cases of regressed <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ROP</info>. A second <info type="SequenceVariant">heterozygotic 14-bp deletion</info> was detected in an unaffected <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ex-premature</info> girl. Only two of the 13 <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie-FEVR</info> index cases had the full features of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info> with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">deafness</info> and <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">mental retardation</info>. CONCLUSION: Two novel <info type="SequenceVariant">mutations</info> within the coding region of the <info type="GeneOrGeneProduct">NDP</info> gene were found, one associated with a severe <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">disease phenotypes</info> of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info> and the other with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">FEVR</info>. A <info type="SequenceVariant">deletion</info> within the non-coding region was associated with only mild-regressed <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">ROP</info>, despite the presence of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">low birthweight</info>, <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">prematurity</info> and exposure to <info type="ChemicalEntity">oxygen</info>. In full-term children with <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">retinal detachment</info> only 15% appear to have the full features of <info type="DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature">Norrie disease</info> and this is important for counselling parents on the possible long-term outcome.

### Explanation of Refinements:
- **Metallothionein signaling** became **Metallothionein signaling pathway** for clarity regarding its nature as a pathway.
- **Immunoregulatory genes** was refined to **Immunoregulatory genes in IBD** to specify the context of their relevance to inflammatory bowel disease.
- **Fatty acid metabolism genes** was updated to **Fatty acid metabolism genes in IBD** to provide context that relates these genes specifically to inflammatory bowel disease.
